### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Front-End developer and looking for a full-time position in a company. Have finished GOIT Full stack course. I'm not afraid of challenges, I like to overcome them ðŸ˜Ž. I am experienced in team projects and find a common language with people. I want to develop my skills in a team of like-minded people.
